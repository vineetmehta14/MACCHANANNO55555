# pycurity
A list of python hacking scripts I wrote with the guide of [this book](http://amzn.to/2iaG8t6)

This is a current work in progress.

I also have some PenTesting/ Hacking and Coding videos on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGISJ8ZHkmIv1CaoHovK-Xw) if you're into that.

As soon as I've finished the book, I'll fork this project and create a more usefull pentesting-framework.

# List of Scripts and what they do:
## crackers
### unzip.py
A simple zip-pw dictionary cracker.

Usage:
``` bash
python unzip.py -f <zipfile> -d <dictionary_file>
```

This script will crack a pw- protected zip file with a dictionary list. It will create a pseudo- Thread for each dictionary_file line to speed up the process.

## metasploit
### conficker.py
Clone of conficker exploit

Usage:
``` bash
python -H <RHOST[s]> -l <LHOST> [-p <LPORT> -F <Password File>]
```
Simplifies the process of creating a conficker exploit by handling all the configuration and launching the exploit via msf.

## scanners
### port_scanner.py
A port scanner for hostnames/ips and port(s)

Usage: 
``` bash
python port_scanner.py -H <ip-adress> -p <single port>
python port_scanner.py -H <ip-adress> -p "<mutliple ports separated by comma>"
# eg for multiple port scan
python port_scanner.py -H 127.0.0.1 -p "20, 21, 443"
```

### nmap\_port_scanner.py
Same as [port_scanner.py](#port_scannerpy) but with nmap integration.

### simple\_vuln_scanner.py
A simple scanner for common vulnerabilities.

Usage: 
``` bash
python simple_vuln_scanner.py <vuln_list.txt>
```

vuln_list.txt can contain banner info like
- "FreeFloat FTP Server"
- "3Com 3CDaemon FTP Server Version 2"

as suggested by the book. Not limited to FTP- Services.

Scans some ports in a range of IP- Adresses to get vulnerable services.

## ssh

### ssh_dictionary.py
A simple brute-forcer for ssh connections, using a dictionary.

Usage:
``` bash
python ssh_dictionary.py -H <hostname> -u <username> -F <password- file>
```
Tries to brute- force an ssh connection for a given user using a dictionary.
